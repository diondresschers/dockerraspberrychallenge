# Agenda

1. Who are we
1. What are we going to do
1. What are we NOT going to do 
1. In the beginning...
1. The Challenge...
1. Techniques and follow up
1. Let's go crazy!

# Who are we

* We are the Linux Amsterdam Foundation
* Founded on 7 January 2014 with 20+ members
* We have the goal to share knowledge of Linux platforms and Open Source
* [www.linuxamsterdam.nl](https://www.linuxamsterdam.nl "Titel tekst").
* Daniel Kropveld and Dion Dresschers

# What are we going to do

* We are going to get two useful Docker images running
* It has to run on a Rasbperry Pi
* The two Docker images have to be useful (like a blog and online storage)
* The two services have have to be accessable from the internet
* We are going to configure stuff and talk about it

---

# What are we NOT going to do 

* We are NOT going to teach you how to use Linux or Docker
* We CAN give you useful information and a helping community

# In the beginning...



---

## Problem 

* I've created a Blog for my sister on my VPS
* The site got hacked (I didn't have snaphots or backups)
* Now I wanted to host it at my own home

---

## Advantages

* More challenging
* Learningcurve
* Cost reduction
* Privacy

---

## Disadvantages

* Engery costs
* At home ADSL (slow upload speed)
* Redundancy !?

---

## Requirements

* Low enery costs
* The ability to run run more domains
  * www.desireedresschers.nl
  * owncloud.dresschers.net
* Backup
* (Reduncandy)


---

## The Server / Processor

* At home a Intel i5 desktop with 16GB (about 150 engery costs a year)
* The search for a more energyfriendly computer which is the Rasperry Pi
* Raspberry has ARM processor RISC vs Intel CISC
* RISC is Reduced Instruction Set Computing, energy saver!

The first ARM Processor

---


![mobiles]

[mobiles]: images/mobiles.png "alternatieve tekst"

Almost everybody is using ARM.

Differences between Raspberry Pi's

---

## The OS of the Rasbpery Pi 3

* Raspbian 
* 1991 Linux is compatible with Unix OS by Linux Thorvalds (Unix was too expensive)
* Kernel of Linux has been merged with the tools of GNU (Open Source Unix alternative)
* Debian is the Linux distribution (openly in the spirit of the GNU Project)

---


![os]

[os]: images/os.png "alternatieve tekst"

Choices between different OS'es for the RPi.

---

## The OS of the Raspberry Pi 3

* Raspbian 8 (Jessie), Raspbian 7 (Wheezy)
* Ubuntu Snappy Core (64-bit)
* Ubuntu Mate (Desktop)
* Windows 10 IOT Core
* RISC OS
* Others

---

Techniques

* DNS (done at www.gandi.net)
* NAT (done in the ADSL router)
* '/etc/hosts'-file
* Apache
* Apache Virtualhosts

# Backup

Lame, but you can duplicate the RPi SD card:

```bash
# dd if=/dev/sdb1 of=/home/dion/rpi_backup
```

# The Challenge...

---

# The Challenge:

To do more or less the same, but now with Docker Images

---


Why Docker?

* Cleaner
* More modular/separated
* Less work (!?)
* Faster (!?)

---

![docker]

[docker]: images/docker.png "alternatieve tekst"

Why using Docker

---

# Techniques and follow up

* Still DNS 
* Still NAT
* [Get started with Docker](https://docs.docker.com/linux/ "alt")
* [Hypriot Image](http://blog.hypriot.com/downloads/)
* [Ubuntu Snappy Core](http://www.ubuntu.com/cloud/snappy)
* [Proxy you Docker images](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29519215/my-websites-running-in-docker-containers-how-to-implement-virtual-host "alt")
* [Wordpress with Docker](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-dockerise-and-deploy-multiple-wordpress-applications-on-ubuntu "alt")
* Whatever you want...
  * Snaphots
  *  Backup
  * Trend analysis
  * Web Certificate (HTTPS)
  * Site Recovery
